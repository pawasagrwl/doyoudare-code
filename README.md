# Do You Dare - A Song Guessing Game

WIP

## Overview

WIP

This repository is divided into two main sections:
- `doyoudare-fe`: The frontend codebase, responsible for the user interface and client-side logic.
- `doyoudare-be`: The backend codebase, powering the game's server, APIs, and database interactions.

## Features

WIP

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: The frontend architecture and technologies are under development, focusing on creating a responsive and intuitive user experience.
- **Backend**: The backend is built in an MVP state, utilizing [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) for the server and [Express](https://expressjs.com/) for routing. It currently operates locally, with plans to expand for production deployment.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/doyoudare.git
   ```
2. Install NPM packages for both frontend and backend
   ```sh
   cd doyoudare-fe
   npm install
   cd ../doyoudare-be
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the backend server locally
   ```sh
   npm start
   ```
   The backend server should now be running on `localhost:3000`.

4. (Frontend development is in progress. Instructions will be updated once available.)
